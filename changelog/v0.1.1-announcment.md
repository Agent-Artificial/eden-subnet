# ðŸš€ Changelog v0.1.1 Announcement ðŸš€

We have released v0.1.1 of the Eden Subnet, which includes substantial updates and new features aimed at improving the overall mining experience on our network. Our goal is to make mining on Commune easy, safe, and accessible while ensuring the network remains dynamic and welcoming to new users. Here are the key updates and the reasoning behind them:

## Key Updates:

### Improved Miner-Validator Pairing:

- Validator calls to miners now resolve correctly, addressing a conflict between the module import method and the HTTP method.
    This fix ensures that validator calls are reliable, which is crucial for the smooth operation of the network.

### Code Simplification:

- Validator code has been simplified with a more streamlined inheritance chain from the original design, aiming for short-term stability.
Future Direction: We plan to move towards more modular designs based on APIs and RPC calls directly to the chain, reducing reliance on module imports and inheritance.
    Simplified code enhances stability and maintainability. Future modular designs will make the system more flexible and scalable.

### Enhanced Validation System:

- Validation now uses a scaled rank system that considers previous weights and current stakes, replacing the previous method of simple sentiment analysis.
    This change provides a more nuanced and fair validation process, encouraging miner churn and allowing new users to join the network by preventing incumbents from becoming immovable.

### Boosts and Modifiers:

- We have added a boost for users who provided miners in the previous vote, with a diminishing scale being considered to prevent entrenched positions. Additionally, a weight modifier based on stake has been introduced.
    Boosting previous contributors rewards ongoing participation while the weight modifier incentivize investment in server development. These changes aim to balance stability with the opportunity for new users to join and thrive.

### Simplified Launching:

- Multiple launching options have been removed to reduce complexity. Now, users only need to import the Miner or Validator class and the appropriate Settings class, then execute the Python script.
    Simplifying the launch process makes it more user-friendly, reducing barriers to entry for new users and improving overall usability.

### New Launcher Utility:

- A new launcher utility for Linux users has been added. Follow the prompts after executing:
bash Copy code```
chmod +x launch.sh
bash launch.sh```
Requirements: Ensure you have a key in `~/.commune/key` with a balance to cover the stake and fees.
    This utility simplifies the setup process for Linux users, making it easier to start mining or validating.

### Documentation Updates:

- The README has been updated to reflect recent changes.

### Testing:

- Added testing to the core repo to provide a solid foundation for future development.
    Comprehensive testing is crucial for maintaining code quality and stability, allowing us to build confidently on this foundation.
